About me
--------

I am an applied scientist focused on natural language processing and machine learning. I recently started something new at [Objective, Inc.](https://www.objective.inc).
Previously, I was a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Apple in California.

I received my PhD at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.illc.uva.nl/), where I worked with [Prof. Khalil Sima'an](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/k.simaan/) on machine translation. From 2011 until 2013, I was a Master's student in the [EM LCT](http://lct-master.org) programme in Computational Linguistics at Charles University in Prague and the University of Groningen. In my Master thesis, I worked on robust dependency parsing of noisy content with [Gertjan van Noord](http://www.let.rug.nl/vannoord/) and [Dan Zeman](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/daniel-zeman). During my undergraduate studies at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, I worked at the German Research Center for Artifical Intelligence.

## Research Interests

Within the area of Natural Language Processing, my research interests are 
in applications and evaluation of large language and vision models, machine translation, entity linking and dependency parsing.

## Software and data

- [Semantic analogy-based compound splitter](https://github.com/jodaiber/semantic_compound_splitting): An unsupervised compound splitter based on the regularities in the vector space of word embeddings.
- [The Denoised Web Treebank](DenoisedWebTreebank): Dependency treebank for evaluation of parser robustness.
- [FilmTit](https://github.com/runn1ng/FilmTit): Translation memory application for movie subtitles.
- [DBpedia Spotlight](http://spotlight.dbpedia.org/): I created an efficient and more accurate version of the multilingual entity linking system DBpedia Spotlight.
- [Raw Spotlight data](entity-linking): Raw counts for entity linking in many languages.
